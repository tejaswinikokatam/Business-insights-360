# Business-insights-360
## Project Overview
The Business Insights 360 Project is a comprehensive data visualization initiative created using Power BI. It is designed to provide stakeholders with real-time insights customized to their specific needs. The project comprises five primary views: Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, and Executive, each of which emphasizes key metrics and KPIs to facilitate data-driven decision-making.
## Problem Statement
AtliQ Hardware, a global supplier of computer peripherals, initially enjoyed success but encountered significant losses in recent years. This decline can be attributed to their reliance on static Excel reports, which failed to deliver the insights necessary for informed decision-making. As a result, they sought the expertise of a data analytics team to develop a dynamic Power BI dashboard, serving as a multifunctional tool offering insights from various departments, including Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Supply Chain.
## Project Objectives

The project was executed through the following phases:

*Project Planning
*Data Collection, Exploration, Transformation
*Data Modeling
*Dashboard Preparation
*Data Validation & Stakeholder Feedback Implementation
